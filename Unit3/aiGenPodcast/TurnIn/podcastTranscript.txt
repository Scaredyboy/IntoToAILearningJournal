Cold Open (0:00–0:30)

[Jake]: Okay, picture this—you and your buddy have been beefing for weeks, 
like petty roommate-level beef, and instead of sending that ‘we cool?’ text, 
you both literally bury an axe in the ground and call it even. Yeah, that was 
a real thing.

[Matt]: And, uh, on the flip side—imagine waking up buried six feet under, 
but there’s a little string tied to your hand, connected to a bell above ground. 
You start ringing it like crazy, hoping somebody hears you. That’s how some 
people thought the phrase “saved by the bell” got started.

[Jake]: Pretty intense, right? Let’s get into it.

Intro (0:30–1:00)

[Matt]: Hey everybody, welcome back to Behind the Words, the podcast where 
we dig into weird little stories hiding inside the phrases we use every day.

[Jake]: I’m Jake.

[Matt]: And I’m Matt.

[Jake]: Today we’re breaking down two classics: “bury the hatchet” and 
“saved by the bell.” Spoiler—both of them sound way more dramatic than how we 
use them now.

[Matt]: Like, nobody’s burying actual weapons after fighting over dirty dishes.

[Jake]: Sadly.

Main Content (1:00–4:30)

[Jake]: Alright, let’s start with bury the hatchet. So this one comes from
 Indigenous North American traditions. When rival tribes decided, “Hey, let’s 
 stop fighting,” they would literally bury their weapons—hatchets, tomahawks, 
 that kind of thing. It was a ritual, super symbolic.

[Matt]: Yeah, it wasn’t just like a handshake and a “we good?” It was an actual 
ceremony—covering violence with the earth, like saying, “We’re done here.”

[Jake]: Europeans saw this in the 1600s, wrote about it, and eventually the 
phrase stuck around in English. Now we just toss it into conversations like, 
“Eh, me and my buddy buried the hatchet after that dumb argument.”

[Matt]: Which is way easier than, like, carrying around a shovel and a spare 
axe just for dramatic effect.

[Jake]: [laughs] Imagine doing that after a fight with your roommate. “Hold up, 
man, lemme grab my hatchet.”

[Matt]: That would actually end the argument real quick.

[Jake]: True. So yeah, next time you hear it, remember it’s rooted in actual 
peace rituals, not just sitcom-level squabbles.

[Matt]: Alright, let’s flip to saved by the bell. Most people have heard the 
creepy version, right? Like, people being buried alive in the 1700s and 1800s, 
medicine not exactly knowing who was dead and who was, uh, really, really asleep.

[Jake]: Yeah, so families would rig up graves with a little string tied to the 
person’s hand, running up to a bell above the ground. If the person woke up underground, 
they could tug on the string. Creepy as hell, but also kind of genius.

[Matt]: I don’t know, man, imagine being the poor guy assigned to sit in the graveyard 
at night just in case a bell rings. Like—nah, I’m good.

[Jake]: Yeah, hard pass. But here’s the twist—historians say the phrase more 
likely comes from boxing in the 1800s.

[Matt]: Right, if a fighter was getting wrecked but then the round-ending bell 
rang, boom—they were “saved by the bell.”

[Jake]: Which honestly makes more sense. It’s less “horror movie in a graveyard,” 
more “Rocky barely making it to the next round.”

[Matt]: Still, I kinda love the spooky grave version. It sticks in your head.

[Jake]: Same. Either way, the meaning’s the same—you’re about to take an L, 
then suddenly something swoops in and saves you.

[Matt]: Like when your professor is about to call on you, and then class ends. 
Saved. By. The. Bell.

[Jake]: Or when your boss is about to ask you to stay late, and the fire alarm 
goes off.

[Matt]: That’s the good stuff.

Conclusion (4:30–5:00)

[Jake]: So yeah, today we learned “bury the hatchet” comes from actual peace 
ceremonies, and “saved by the bell” is probably more boxing than graveyard horror, 
but both are way cooler than how we use them.

[Matt]: Next time you say either one, just know there’s some serious history—or 
at least spooky grave vibes—backing you up.

[Jake]: Thanks for hanging with us on Behind the Words.

[Matt]: Don’t forget to subscribe, and, uh, bury the hatchet with your friends.

[Jake]: Or at least let the bell save you. Catch you next time.
