For this project I used a few different tools to create my podcast. I started with ChatGPT 
which I used to generate the whole script for the podcast because I felt like I needed it 
written out before I could move on to the audio part of the podcast. After I had the script, 
I used Eleven Labs to create voices for the characters. Then I went to YouTube to find background 
music to make the podcast sound fuller and not just 2 guys talking in silence. The whole process 
worked but it was harder than I expected in some areas. The main challenge for me was trying to 
find a free AI program that could read the script in a way that sounded decent enough. I tried 
a lot of different voices and spent a lot of time testing them, but many of them didn’t sound 
right or just couldn’t read the script at all. Eventually, I just went with the two of the voices 
from Eleven Labs because they could read the script well and the voices were good enough, I could 
actually listen to them speak over and over.

Although I actually got the project to work for me, I just don’t like the way using AI feels. It 
feels like a shortcut or even cheating, because instead of doing all the work myself I’m just 
depending on the tech to fill in the gaps that I don’t want to do. It made the process easier, but 
it didn’t feel anywhere near as genuine as if I had written, recorded, and edited everything on my own. 
Something I realized through this experience though is that AI can be both simple and difficult at the 
same time. Sometimes it gives you what you want right away, but other times it doesn’t work at all 
the way you hoped. When it doesn’t work, it can feel like the only option is to start over completely, 
which gets frustrating.
