What is prompt engineering? 
	- Where you guid the ai to do what you want with the shortest input for the best input
	- Better user imput prompts will lead to more consistant work, efficent work, and it makes using ai cheaper
	
A Prompt: A prompt is the text input from the user to get the ai to create somthing
	- Giving ai the same prompt twice will give a different output
	
Prompt tips:
	- Be more clear and in depth with the wording
	- Ask it to do EVERYTHING you want it to do (The Ai does not know what you want)
	- If the Ai keeps failing try just rewording what you said
		Example: Write a marketing plan.  
				 Write a story about how this product fits ito the lives of the target customer demographic.
	- Give constraints
	
	- Google steps for Prompt
		Task: 
			Persona (who the Ai is) 
			Format: output type
		Context:
			Good: Give me some ideas for a birthday present. under $30
			Great: Give me five ideas for a birthday present. my budget is $30. the gift is for a 29 year old who loves winter sports, 
				   and has recently swithed to snowboarding from skiing.
		Referance: 
			Additional input data, ideas
		Evaluate:
			Evaluate the output
			does it meet the requirments
			is the format right
			are the ideas good
		Iterate:
			Tell the Ai to fix any issues until its to your standards
			Always be Iterating
			issues would be with TCR (Task, Context, Referance)

Random Notes:
	Never forget the ai can just be wrong
	input is cheaper than output 
	try not to break your whole task into one prompt. Break your task up into multiple prompts
	Larger prompts trying to get multiple things at once it will be a worse output
