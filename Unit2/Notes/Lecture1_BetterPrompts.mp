# Unit 2 Lecture 1: Better Prompts & Prompt Engineering

## What is Prompt Engineering?
Prompt engineering is the practice of guiding AI to produce desired outputs using the shortest, most effective input possible.

**Benefits of Better Prompts:**
- More consistent results
- More efficient AI performance  
- Lower costs (since input is cheaper than output)

## Understanding Prompts
**Definition:** A prompt is the text input from a user that instructs the AI to create something.

**Important Note:** Giving AI the same prompt twice will typically produce different outputs due to the probabilistic nature of AI models.

## Essential Prompt Tips

### 1. Be Clear and Detailed
- Use precise, in-depth wording
- Specify exactly what you want the AI to accomplish
- Remember: The AI doesn't know your intentions unless you state them clearly

### 2. Include Everything You Want
Ask the AI to do EVERYTHING you need in your prompt - don't assume it will infer missing requirements.

### 3. Reword When Stuck
If the AI keeps failing, try rephrasing your request entirely.

**Example:**
- ❌ Weak: "Write a marketing plan"
- ✅ Better: "Write a story about how this product fits into the lives of the target customer demographic"

### 4. Provide Constraints
Set clear boundaries and limitations to guide the AI's output.

## Google's Prompt Framework

### T - Task
- **Persona:** Define who the AI should act as
- **Format:** Specify the desired output type

### C - Context
Provide relevant background information and specifics.

**Examples:**
- ❌ Good: "Give me some ideas for a birthday present under $30"
- ✅ Great: "Give me five ideas for a birthday present. My budget is $30. The gift is for a 29-year-old who loves winter sports and has recently switched to snowboarding from skiing."

### R - Reference
Include additional input data, examples, or ideas to guide the AI.

### E - Evaluate
Always assess the output:
- Does it meet your requirements?
- Is the format correct?
- Are the ideas/content high quality?

### I - Iterate
Continuously refine your prompts:
- Tell the AI to fix any issues until it meets your standards
- Always be iterating and improving
- Focus on improving Task, Context, and Reference elements

## Key Reminders

⚠️ **Critical Points:**
- AI can be wrong - always verify important information
- Input tokens are cheaper than output tokens
- Break complex tasks into multiple focused prompts rather than one massive prompt
- Larger prompts trying to accomplish multiple things simultaneously often produce worse outputs

## Best Practices Summary
1. Start specific and detailed
2. Provide clear context and constraints  
3. Evaluate every output critically
4. Iterate and refine continuously
5. Break complex tasks into smaller, focused prompts
